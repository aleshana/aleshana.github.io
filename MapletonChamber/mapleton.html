                    <p> A fairly new city by anyone standards, Mapleton wasn’t incorporated until 1948.  Originally the land was 
                        used by settlers and farmers for grazing and farming form around Utah County.  In the 1850’s the land was 
                        surveyed for farming and irrigation.  Irrigation was installed by a group of men shortly after.  The first 
                        permanent settlers came in the 1870s.   The area was originally called Union Bench.   But was later changed 
                        to Mapleton in the early 1900s.

                    <p> It was during the 1900s that many of the residents were not being heard by the city of Springville.  Because 
                        they were further out, they had different needs and conditions.  A petition was started to separate from 
                        Springville and start their own community.  The city was named after a small grove of Maple trees at the base 
                        of Maple Canyon.
                    </p>
                    <p> It has continued to grow and flourish over the years.   The city has had it’s fair share of challenges throughout 
                        the state and nations history.  With time, many of the farms have phased out.  It is becoming much more metropolitan.  
                        Many people from all over are now settling in the city adding it to the new modern area.

                    <p> Mapleton loves its rural charm which is fast disintegrating with all the farmland being used up 
                        for new home developments.  Many new move people are moving in, including a healthy dose from California.
                        The population is growing rapidly.  During its last US census, the population was around 9,000, 
                        it is believed to be more around 20,000 now as we wait the results of the 2020 census.

                    <p> The city is located about 8 miles from Provo, 5 miles from Spanish Fork, and 3.5 from Springville. One of its most 
                        charming features is the view of Maple Mountain, once called Sierra Bonita.  The mountain offers a 
                        since of familiarity and comfort to its residents as well as wonderful seasonal views.  The. City has a 
                        total of 6 parks so far in its 12 square mile radius.   The residents are hoping for more soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>The public school district in the area is the Nebo District, one of the best in the state for test scores.
                        Along with a great school district, the city's schools also have consisitly ranked in the top schools in
                        the state.  They are always in the top 1%.  There are many young children and invested residents in giving 
                        their young residents a quality education.  Crime is low with superb leadership in the first responders in the 
                        city.

                    <p> The future of Mapleton can only be surmised as with any other place.  Current forecasts put property values
                        homes in very high price ranges in 30 years.  In fact, it is predicted that home values will rival the 
                        costs of homes in Silicone Valley.  As people seek to put down roots these days, everyone wants to return
                        to their place of heritage.  Those of whom bought homes in the housing recession of 2011 and 2012 have
                        seen their home values double and in some cases triple in just ten years.

                    <p> New schools are being built to accomodate the growth.  However, the commercial side and commerece development 
                        of Mapelton are sorely lacking leading to high tax rates for its residents.  New people moving in want to keep
                        the small town feel while long time residents are struggling to pay taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p> Many of the city traditions will continue to happen.  They are a favorite of not only Mapelton residents but many
                        of the surrounding areas too.  Fortunately for the city, many local businesses help promote and pay for <thead></thead> 
                        activities.
