      <p class = "homeArticle1Para">A massive bolt of lightening hit the Preston, Idaho
          power plant filling up the station's energy coffers.  During Wednesday's nights rainstorm,
          the lightening hit the exact spot of the power plants generator, filling it to capacity.
          The stunned power manager, John Electrica said, "I have never seen anything like this before,
          residents will have free power for months."  
      </p>
       <p>Although, no one say the exact bolt, residents nearby report the load boom and a fully 
           lighted night sky.  When the employees of Preston Energy Incorporated inspected the plant,
           there was evidence of sparking and only cosmetic burnt spots.  One employee, Susan Lightfoot 
           exclaimed, "With the recent power shortages, this is nothing short of a miracle."
       </p>
        <p>Many national experts are claiming the event to be impossible.  However, Electrica has 
            confidentally invited all skeptics to the scene.  "There is just no other explanation than
            the events that we have described.  For now, we will just all give thanks for this blessed
            power supply."

      <p class = "homeArticle2Para">The fish hole of residents from Fish Haven was suddenly stocked 
          with new fish from an unlikely source.  People close to Fish Haven Reservoir reported a large
          dark cloud suddenly hovering over the water.  Suddenly, the cloud began to rain fish. The cloud
          continued to shower the lake with what appeared to be rainbow trout, a favorite fish among
          residents.  
      </p>
       <p>The National Forest Service was there today counting and sampling the fish.  Roger Forester,
           a wild life and fish expert from the forest service said, "these are the biggest and tastiet
           fish I have ever seen.  Adding that there is just the right fish population for a healthy 
           fish environment."  
       </p>
        <p>The State of Idaho announced earlier this year, that Fish Haven Reservoir
            would not be stocked with year due to budget cuts.  Many residents and tourists who frequent
            the beloved fish whole had unsuccessfully petitioned the state to change their stance.
            Local resident, Janet Salmon, joyful proclaimed, "My family will be able to eat fish all 
            year now."

          causing the entire body of water to freeze solid.  Meteorolgists are baffled by the quick moving
          extremely small cold front that materialized and then disappaited over Soda Springs Pond. George
          Weatherman, a local broadcaster for Channel 11, was flabergasted saying, "I have never seen anything like this.  It's 
          as if the Boys Championship Hockey Game just had to happen!"
      </p>
       <p>Many residents claim that this is proof that hockey is a divine sport.  Alice Jumper, whose son
           is on the Soda Spring Boys Hockey Team, said, "This is proof that hockey games are a matter
           of great signficance.  No one will ever say, 'It's just a game' anymore."
       </p>
        <p>A cold front in extreme is potentially dangerous for surrounding areas.  However, state farm
            inspectors say that no farms were damaged or touched.  Jacob Plowman, a neighboring farmer,
            claimed the cold front didn't harm is crops at all. "And now I get to sit back and watch the
            championship game from my porch."  The original game had been postponed indefinitely until 
            the city arean's zambogy was repaired.  The game has now been moved to Soda Springs Pond which 
            has inexplicable remained frozen.

      <p class = "homeArticle4Para">Whitnesses claim yesterday, that it was a scene right out of
          the "Wizard of Oz".  An old pioneer home was picked up by a sudden windstorm and transported
          mile away.  The appeared to land intact and completely unharmed 50 yards from North Fork
          Creek. It is unclear whether the wind was an actual tornado or just a really strong gust.
      </p>
       <p>Annie Mayberry, owner of the home, was relieved to have the home transorted safely to such
           a beautiful setting.  The home was scheduled to be demolished tomorrow to make way for
           the new highway.  Mayberry had fought the road, claming that her ancestors had built the 
           home and lived there for decades.  Mayberry herself was also born in the home.  Fortuately 
           for her, the home landed on her one of her remaining 50 acres of property. "I just told 
           everyone that Earest Hillbilly, my ancestor, was just turning over in is grave at
           his house being torn down.  But I guess he was doing a lot more than that, I just sure his 
           ghost caused this."  Mayberry claims that all of her children and grandchildren were born
           in the home too.  "This house is protected by generations of Hillbilly ancestors." she
           claimed.
