        <h2>Application of the Colors</h2>
        <h3>Charcoal</h3>
        <p>Charcoal will be used as the main body text color.  It is also used in the frist and third heading because it 
            is a dark color.  It will also be used occasionally as a backgroud with a light colored text to add contrast
            and break up the page.
        </p>
        <h3>Mikado-Yellow</h3>
        <p>This yellow was choosen to add "pop" in the website.  It also feels "sunny" and goes well with the website
            content.  It will be used for the second headling with a shadow.  Mikado-yellow is also the main color in
            the logo.
        </p>
        <h3>Wild Blue Yonder</h3>
        <p>The wild blue yonder color is perfect for a weather site.  it will be used as an accent and a backgroud.
            Both of those elements will help break-up the space and add interest.

        </p>
        <h3>Floral White</h3>
        <p>This floral white is used for the main color of the page, the white space.  This was used to add a muted
            feel to the white and to help blend the other colors in the color scheme. 
        </p>
        <h3>Nyanza</h3>
        <p>
            Green is a color overwhelmingly found in nature.  It fits the theme of the website.  This pale green is used as
            background in the third heading.  It will be used as text on the charcoal background and as an occasional accent.
        </p>
        <h3>Tea Green</h3>
        <p>
            The tean green color is a darker hugh than the nyanza green. The main body of the website is done in this green. It adds 
            interest and will be used for accent.  It also helps balance out the bright yellow color.
